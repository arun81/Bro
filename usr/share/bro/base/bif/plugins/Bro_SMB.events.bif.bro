# This file was automatically generated by bifcl from /build/securityonion-bro-bmYGD9/securityonion-bro-2.5.5/src/analyzer/protocol/smb/events.bif (plugin mode).

## Generated for :abbr:`SMB (Server Message Block)` connections when a
## named pipe has been detected heuristically.  The case when this comes
## up is when the drive mapping isn't seen so the analyzer is not able
## to determine whether to send the data to the files framework or to
## the DCE_RPC analyzer. This heuristic can be tuned by adding or
## removing "named pipe" names from the :bro:see:`SMB::pipe_filenames`
## const.
##
## c: The connection.
